### PokeIndex

A simple PokeIndex application built with **React** and **CSS** that fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display information about Pokémon.

---

### Features

- **Search Functionality**: Search for Pokémon by their name or ID.
- **Detailed Information**: Displays the Pokémon's image, name, and type(s).
- **Dynamic Background Colors**: The background adapts based on the Pokémon's type(s).
- **User-Friendly UI**: Clean and responsive interface styled with CSS.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and handling application logic.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and creating a visually appealing design.
- **PokeAPI**: For fetching real-time Pokémon data.

### How It Works

1. Enter a Pokémon's name or ID in the search bar.
2. Press the "Submit" button to fetch data from the API.
3. View detailed Pokémon information, including:
   - Pokémon image
   - Name (converted to uppercase for emphasis)
   - Type(s) (displayed with type-specific background colors)
